# Dice Game by Deron:
I made this user-interactive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a dice game. 
### Read the instructions:
This is a dice game. When a player clicks on the button, a random number get's displayed on his square. 
Player1 starts the game. The player who's score gets more than 25 wins the game!!!
Do not get sad when you lose the game. Keep trying again until you succeed.
### Try it out!!! Best of luck!!!
